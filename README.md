# Advent Of Code

Here I will put my solutions for Advent of Code. I solve them in TypeScript.
I strongly discourage you from copying my solutions and recommend solving aoc yourself but if you want to take your own fun away feel free to do so.

## Running

My runner uses [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/) for submitting and downloading

```bash
bun solve -h
```
